  <h2>MSWD</h2>

  The Mean Square Weighted Deviation (MSWD) is a measure of goodness of fit
  that takes into account the relative importance of both the interal and 
  external reproducibility. HelioPlot provides three estimates of the
  'average' age (arithmetic mean, geometric mean and central age), and
  calculates the corresponding MSWD for each of them.
  
  <p>  MSWD = 1 if the age data fit a univariate normal distribution
  in t (for the arithmetic mean age) or log(t) (for the geometric mean age) 
  space, or if the compositional data fit a bivariate normal distribution in
  [log(U/He),log(Th/He)]-space (for the central age).
  
  <p>  MSWD &#60; 1 if the observed scatter is less than that predicted by the analytical
  uncertainties. In this case, the data are said to be "underdispersed", indicating
  that the analytical uncertainties were overestimated.
  
  <p>  MSWD &#62; 1 if the observed scatter exceeds that predicted by the analytical uncertainties.
  In this case, the data are said to be "overdispersed". This situation is the rule
  rather than the exception in (U-Th)/He geochronology, indicating an incomplete
  understanding of the isotope system. Several reasons have been proposed to explain the
  overdispersion of (U-Th)/He data, including unevenly distributed U-Th distributions
  and radiation damage.
