  <h2>Samarium</h2>

Only one &#945;-particle is produced per <sup>147</sup>Sm, whereas six to eight 
are formed in the Th and U decay series. Therefore, Sm can often be neglected
as a source of radiogenic helium. In rare cases, however, Sm can be extremely
enriched in apatite, and does significantly affect the age. <tt>HelioPlot</tt>
can switch between (U-Th)/He and (U-Th-Sm)/He dating by selecting the appropriate
option in <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Input</tt>. If (U-Th-Sm)/He is selected,
Sm will be used as the colour code for the error ellipses. Samples with missing Sm 
data are coloured white. Sm is used for the age calculations even if the
(U-Th)/He option is selected. If the Sm data are complete, the geometric 
mean Sm concentration is used as a common reference for the ternary diagram
and logratio plot. If any of the Sm compositions is missing, the ternary
diagram and logratio plot will use a reference value of zero.
