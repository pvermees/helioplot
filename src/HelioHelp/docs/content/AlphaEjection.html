      <h2>&#945;-ejection correction</h2>
      
      &#945;-decay of <sup>238</sup>U, <sup>235</sup>U, <sup>232</sup>Th
      and <sup>147</sup>Sm is associated with kinetic energies of 4-8 MeV.
      &#945; particles with such high energies travel on average 20 &#956;m in 
      apatite before coming to rest. This results in a loss of <sup>4</sup>He,
      which must be corrected for through division by the &#945;-retention
      factor F<sub>t</sub>, which can be calculated by polynomial approximation.
      A common mistake is to apply the &#945;-ejection correction <i>after</i>
      the age calculation, i.e. by dividing the uncorrected age by F<sub>t</sub>.
      This leads to a partial linearisation of the age equation and a loss of
      accuracy. To ensure optimal accuracy, either divide He by F<sub>t</sub>
      or multiply U, Th and Sm with F<sub>t</sub> <i>before</i> entry into <tt>HelioPlot</tt>'s
      input table (Vermeesch, 2008; Ketcham, 2009).
