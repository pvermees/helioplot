      The age contours of both ternary diagrams and logratio plots can be
      changed by clicking
      <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Colours</tt> &#8594; <tt>Contour Colours</tt>.
      This brings up a colour scale, the minimum and maximum values of
      which can be selected by clicking the appropriate swatches or adjusting
      the RGB sliders.
      
      <p> 
      A separate set of colours is used for the error ellipses of the (U-Th)/He
      data. This colours are either taken from the optional ninth column of the 
      input table, or from the Sm concentrations, if the ninth column is empty.
      The ninth input column can be seen and edited only if the <tt>(U-Th)/He</tt> 
      option is selected in <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Input</tt>.
      Although this will hide the Sm content from the input table, 
      the Sm values will still be used behind the scenes for the age calculation.
      Conversely, selecting the <tt>(U-Th-Sm)/He</tt> option in <tt>Options</tt>
      &#8594; <tt>Input</tt> reveals the Sm values and hides the colour data,
      but these will still be used to determine the fill colour of the ellipses
      and the associated colour legend. The colour scale can be changed by clicking 
      <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Colours</tt> &#8594; <tt>Ellipse Colours</tt>.
