      <h2>Saving the output</h2>
      
<tt>HelioPlot</tt>  is capable  of saving  the graphical  output  as either
bitmap  or  vector images,  in  a <tt>.png</tt>  or  <tt>.pdf</tt>  format,
respectively.

<p>
The <tt>.png</tt> (Portable Network Graphics) format  employs a lossless
data compression algorithm.  Using  imaging software such as Microsoft
Paint, Adobe Photoshop,  or the Gimp, this can  be easily converted to
similar formats  such as  <tt>.gif</tt>, <tt>.jpg</tt> or <tt>.bmp</tt>.  The
image resolution of the radial plot  depends on the size of the output
window.  Therefore, for high  quality image quality, it is recommended
to maximise this window.

<p>
Alternatively, the <tt>.pdf</tt>  (Portable Document Format) option saves
the output in  a vector format, which can be  rescaled without loss of
resolution.  If saved  in this  format, the  output can  be  edited in
vector graphics  software such as Adobe Illustrator  or CorelDraw, and
converted to formats like <tt>.eps</tt>, <tt>.ai</tt> or <tt>.svg</tt>.
