  <h2>Adjusting the scale</h2>

  The scale of the ternary diagram and logratio plot can be changed by
  selecting <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Settings</tt>.
  The default scale of the logratio plots goes from -1 to 6 on both axes, but can be
  automatically set to display the sample data at optimal resolution, or changed
  to any other values. The same goes for the helium scaling factor, the default
  value of which is 100. The age contours are automatically
  adjusted to the new scale.
