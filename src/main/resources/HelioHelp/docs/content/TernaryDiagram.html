  <h2>Ternary diagrams</h2>
  
  Although U, Th, and He are three variables, they can be constrained by a 
  constant sum in the (U-Th)/He age equation. Therefore, U-Th-He data only
  represents two degrees of freedom worth of information, and can be visualised
  on a two-dimensional surface. <tt>HelioPlot</tt> implements two methods to
  achieve this, with ternary diagrams and logratio plots. Adding Sm as a 
  fourth variable increases the information content of these diagrams,
  necessitating the use of colour as a visual aid. If the <tt>(U-Th)/He</tt>
  option is selected in <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Input</tt>, the the optional
  <tt>[C]</tt> column is used. If <tt>(U-Th-Sm)/He</tt> is selected, then the
  <tt>Sm</tt> content is used. Samples with missing <tt>[C]</tt> or <tt>Sm</tt> 
  are coloured white. The U, Th, and He end members of the ternary diagram can
  be changed in the <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Settings</tt> menu, affecting
  the size and location of the error ellipses.
